# Trego_Website (Jenco Engineering & Construction)

Project reorganized:
- public/css (styles)
- public/js (client scripts)
- public/images (assets)
- src/api (server endpoints)

Next steps:
1. Copy remaining inline CSS rules from original index.html to public/css/style.css and responsive rules to public/css/responsive.css.
2. Replace placeholder files/URLs (video, maps API key, payment keys).
3. Implement server endpoints in src/api (contact, payment, error logging).
4. Test locally with a simple static server (e.g. serve or live-server) and then add backend.
